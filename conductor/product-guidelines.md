# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style

- **Helpful & Accessible:** Documentation and user-facing text should be easy to understand, even for non-technical users. Avoid unnecessary jargon and explain AI concepts (like embeddings or vector search) in simple terms.
- **Supportive Tone:** The language should guide the user through complex workflows, providing clear instructions and proactive assistance.

## User Experience (UX) Principles

- **AI Transparency:** Always provide context for AI-driven decisions. Users should be able to see "why" a product was matched to a video segment (e.g., visual similarity, text correlation).
- **Efficiency-First:** Design for high-volume workflows. Reviewing and approving AI matches should be fast and require minimal clicks. Use keyboard shortcuts and bulk actions where appropriate.
- **Clarity at Scale:** Maintain a clean and organized interface even when dealing with thousands of products or hundreds of videos. Use robust filtering, sorting, and search capabilities.

## Branding & Visual Design

- **Google Cloud Native:** The visual identity should be consistent with the Google Cloud Console. This includes using similar typography, color palettes, and component libraries to provide a familiar experience for enterprise users.
- **Clean & Professional:** Prioritize functionality and readability over decorative elements.

## Communication Standards

- **Standardized Error Messages:** Provide actionable error messages that explain what went wrong and how the user can fix it.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only the information needed for the current task, allowing users to dive deeper into details only when necessary.
